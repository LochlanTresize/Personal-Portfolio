            <h1>I'm Lochlan</h1>
            <p>I'm a third year pure maths major and Hansen Scholar at the University of Melbourne.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm mainly interested in analysis and probability theory, but I also take comp-sci subjects to complement my major.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently a vacationer at unimelb doing research experience in semiclassical analysis and scattering theory.
            <br><br>
            On the off chance another student is reading, I'm happy to help setup a reading group over the summer or possibly during semester with you and some others. I have some ideas myself or you can suggest something.

            <br><br>
            Feel free to email me for my transcript/resume. You should do the same if you want to have a look at the code for the projects below.

            <br><br>
            github have made some changes to hosting sites, so for now a lot of this site is under construction, and it's bugs and incomplete features are somehwere on my TODO list for the summer.

            I leave these divs here in case you want to see what computing stuff I've been up to in my spare time. The linux setup div will be made into a markdown page when I get the time :)</p>

            <h4>Linux setup</h4>
            <p>Less of a conventional TODO-app project, most of my work in late 2024-early 2025 has been spent moving my life over to linux.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I currently run i3 on arch (thinking about wayland...) and have a pretty basic setup for nvim for latex and writing C code.</p>
                        <br>

                    <p>For the latex side I make use of <a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex">Lervag's vimtex plugin</a> (linked) alongside zathura. The C-stuff is pretty standard.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I spent the most time reading X man-pages and the arch wiki to get the function keys on my laptop working, configuring input devices and monitors, and implementing my keybindings which make writing latex easier.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A fun but challenging project.</p>

            <div class="card">
            <h4>Reccommendation System</h4>
            <p>Worked with another student to build and optimise a user-based KNN reccommendation system on a very large (300k rows) dataset, acheiving a within-2 accuracy of 81 percent with K-Fold validation. An item-based model was also built.</p>

            <p>The findings where collated in a report and the findings presented to a managerial audience.</p>
            
            <p>This project was apart of a data processing class I took in 2024 (some may know which one I'm talking about straight away).</p>

            <h4>Language Identifier web app</h4>
            <p>A web app to showcase a language classifier. Built with htmx and flask (a nice alternative to JS/react for such a simple site.</p>
